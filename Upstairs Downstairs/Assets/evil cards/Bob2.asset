  description: "Bob\u2019s building powers are far too great to be ignored. I could
    let him become a cult leader, using his influence to control the kingdom from
    the shadows and manipulate all who follow him. Or, I could channel his abilities
    for something greater, make him a hero of the continent, and have him protect
    and rebuild the world. "
