  description: "Hey\u2026 y\u2019know that filthy rich merchant? He thinks he\u2019s
    so slick and cool, hoarding wealth and exploiting the poor. I wanna knock him
    down a peg and raid his storage facility take everything he\u2019s got. Or, I
    could terrorize the nobles he bows down to, make them feel the fear he hides
    behind. "
